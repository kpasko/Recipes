My favorite vinaigrette combinations:

Meyer Lemon Juice (when in season: November, December, January)
&
Olio and Olive "Paradiso" Olive Oil
	- available at Bay Cities Italian Deli, $28.99

"O" Cabernet Vinegar
&
Olio and Olive "Cardum" Olive Oil (also Bay Cities)
	- I like to add a tablespoon of Edmund Fallot Dijon mustard to this
